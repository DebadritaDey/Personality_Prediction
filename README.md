# Personality Prediction System  

This project is designed to predict an individual's personality traits based on specific inputs such as gender, age, and scores related to the Big Five Personality Traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, and professional experience. It extracts relevant information from resumes and displays the results, combining the entered data with the parsed resume content. The system employs **logistic regression** for training its predictive model and utilizes the **pyresparser** library, which is built on **nltk** and **spaCy**, for extracting data from resumes.
